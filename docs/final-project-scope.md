# **Project Scope Statement**

## Project Name: Visiting Japan website 

## Project purpose
* Successfully create a website about personal travel to Japan that will demonstrate and display a knowledge base to date in computing applications, including a basic understanding of HTML and CSS. Additionally, it will exhibit concepts learned about project scoping and planning from start to close. 

## Description
* Utilize GitHub to create a repository and a two-page website about personal travel to Japan. Develop the website with basic HTML and CSS using concepts learned to date. Create a scope statement for planning and estimating deliverables and priorities. 

## Desired Results
1. Creation of a live website with 2 pages about personal travels to Japan. The website will use basic knowledge of HTML and CSS.
2. Color palate and design choices will be a personal decision but based on theme.
3. Creation of a GitHub repository for the website that houses documentation information 
4. A README.md file that details information about the website 

## Exclusions
* Limit any functionality or features that go beyond personal knowledge base to date. This is for the prevention of spending too much time away from obtaining key deliverables. Limit website to no more than 2 pages.

## Priorities
* List of priorities in order of importance.
1. Time: Project can begin immediately but is due in two weeks at the end of the semester. There is little to no flexibility here.
2. Quality: It is important that the website is functional and does not need to look elaborate. More time should be spent on planning and presentation
3. Budget: The most important thing to budget for is time. The more time that is set aside for the project then the more likely the project will be successful.

## Acceptance Criteria
* Professor Gamel will need to sign off on the project after completion of project at the end of semester October 3rd.
