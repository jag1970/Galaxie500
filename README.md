# JAPAN

### Land of the Rising Sun
Welcome to my personal website that documents my experience when visiting the great and beautiful country of Japan. The website illustrates two trips taken in 2016 and again in 2018. It discusses challenges learned and showcases many of the beautiful sites visited.
* Home page: This page will give a brief history of Japan and summarize how the plan for these trips came about in both 2016 & 2018.
* About page: This page breaks down each trip and experiences as well as helpful advice for anyone who might want to visit.

I hope you enjoy this website and can glean any information that can help you if you decide to go!

 _Sayonara!_
